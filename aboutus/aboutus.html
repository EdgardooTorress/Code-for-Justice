            <p class="h1_description">Checkup For All is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping low-income families. 
                We spread awareness in our local communities about the lack of accessible & affordable healthcare. 
                Checkup For All also serves these underserved communities with the resources they need, be it financial or health literacy. 
                At Checkup For All, we believe healthcare shouldn't be a luxury.
